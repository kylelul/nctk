# negatives conversion toolkit (NCTK)
NCTK, a project on film negatives preprocessing.

## Background
Up to now, the workflow I'm following I believe can bring me the best image quality and efficiency.
1. Scan negatives /w Epson v700, saved as Silverfast DNG.
2. Crop the DNG the positive scan file in Lightroom, some border left is acceptable. 
3. Convert them with a Plugin -- Negative Lab Pro

So physically put the film into scanner obviously cannot be optimized. You HAVE to do that ANALOG part xD.

Cropping in LR is the most time consuming part in this workflow, and its not related with any color profile transfer or possible sophiscated filter algorithm from LR. I think this can be highly automatic.

Part3, conversion. Frankly, Nathan the creator of NegativeLabPro NLP, had already made the convertion part so easily. But its not free. Later I'd like to see the magic behind id and combine my own knowledge on film, try to implement a conversion algorithm.


## Possibility
Maybe far more than command line executable? Not sure.
